Response:
To determine the cost of the cake's second piece that was eaten by Kevin, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of the flour, sugar, and eggs in the second piece.
2. Add the cost of the butter to the total.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the second piece of cake.
- The first two pieces cost: 2 * $4 + 2 * $2 + 2 * $.5 = $8 + $4 + $1 = $13.
- The second piece costs: $13.

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the second piece.
- The cost of the butter is $2.5.
- The cost of the eggs is $1.
- The cost of the flour sugar is $2.

- Total: $13 (first piece) + $2 (butter) + $2 (eggs) + $1 (flour sugar) = $18.

Therefore, the cost of the second piece of cake that was eaten by Kevin is $18. 

The final answer is \boxed{18}.
