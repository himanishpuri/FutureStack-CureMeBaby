## Inspiration: How We Came Up With This Idea üí°

One of our team members, who is Asian, experienced personal mental health challenges but found that when they finally sought professional help, both family and friends labeled them as "weird." Moreover, he realized that in their culture and in many parts of Asia‚Äîthere's a strong tendency to disregard the need for strict confidentiality. Often, people end up sharing their struggles openly because trusted, discreet care simply isn‚Äôt accessible or valued.

We thought:

> *"What if everyone could access mental health support that stays completely confidential, so they can get help without being judged by family and friends?"*

This exploration led us to design a platform that is not only accessible and adaptive but also offers rock-solid confidentiality. Our research and real-life stories revealed that:

- **Limited Mental Health Infrastructure:** In many Asian countries, a shortage of professionals and inadequate funding mean that reliable mental health care is scarce.
- **Cultural and Social Barriers:** Deep-rooted cultural stigma‚Äîsuch as the need to "save face" and maintain family honor‚Äîoften deters individuals from seeking help. Traditional beliefs and a preference for informal support further compound the problem.
- **Economic and Systemic Challenges:** In regions with underfunded health services and uneven access between urban and rural areas, even those who want help may not be able to receive it in a timely, confidential manner.

Understanding these challenges, we were inspired to create a mental healthcare assistant that preserves the user‚Äôs privacy while delivering personalized, effective support tailored to the unique cultural context of many Asian communities.

## The Problemüöß

In many Asian societies, cultural stigmas associated with mental health often discourage individuals from seeking professional psychiatric help. The perception that visiting a psychiatrist is unusual or "weird" can lead to profound social pressure, causing people to avoid in-person consultations even when they may be struggling with mental health issues. In addition, there is a deep-seated concern about confidentiality as users fear that their private issues may not remain secure in traditional treatment settings. This combination of social stigma and privacy fears creates a significant barrier, leading to unmet mental health needs within these communities.


---

## The Solutionüîë

To address this gap, we have built an AI-driven mental healthcare assistant (psychiatrist) that operates within a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) for maximum data security. By integrating Gensyn Swarm for adaptive and continuously improving support and utilizing NEAR for a decentralized, subscription-based payment model, our solution provides:

**1. Confidentiality:** All interactions occur within a Phala-based TEE, meaning your sensitive mental health data is always protected inside a secure enclave. This advanced layer of security ensures that privacy is never an afterthought.

**2. Accessibility:** Our solution offers an anonymous, online environment where users can access mental health support without the fear of being judged. This enables a broader range of individuals to seek help without social stigma.

**3. Personalization:** At its core, our AI psychiatrist leverages a robust Large Language Model (LLM) to deliver adaptive, empathetic guidance through continuous analysis of daily or session feedback. In this solution, the Gensyn Swarm acts as a collective of multiple LLMs‚Äîessentially a dynamic network of expert agents in conversation‚Äîsharing and refining insights in real time. This collaborative, decentralized "roundtable" of models synthesizes aggregated, anonymized user data to steer each individual toward the optimal path for mental health improvement, ensuring that the support offered is as personalized as it is responsive. We also integrated a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system to make answers even more accurate, grounded, and context-aware.

**4. Engagement:** Our platform also incorporates gamified progress tracking through daily memory snapshots‚Äîconcise visual of the user‚Äôs emotional journey‚Äîthat deliver clear, interactive feedback. This approach not only makes the experience engaging and relatable but also enhances self-awareness and adherence to mental health routines. Additional evidence from health tracking and visual feedback studies further underscores the efficacy of these elements in maintaining long-term engagement and promoting self-management.

## How Our Project Works‚öôÔ∏è

### 1. User Onboarding & Subscription
- **Login with NEAR Wallet:** Users start by logging in using their NEAR wallet.
- **Subscription Payment:** Upon login, users pay 1 NEAR via a smart contract that records their subscription. Renewals are as simple as making another payment, ensuring continuous access month-to-month.

### 2. Personalized Mental Health Interaction
- **AI-Powered Conversations:** Once authenticated, users interact with our AI psychiatrist‚Äîpowered by a robust Large Language Model (LLM)‚Äîto discuss their challenges and receive empathetic guidance.
- **Adaptive Feedback:** The LLM tailors its responses in real time, offering therapeutic prompts and personalized advice based on individual session feedback.

### 3. Daily Progress & Visual Memory Wall
- **Daily Snapshots:** At the end of each day, the system generates a visual or narrative snapshot of the user‚Äôs emotional progress. These snapshots are stored on a memory wall, allowing users to visually track and reflect on their journey.
- **Engaging Feedback:** This gamified progress tracking approach reinforces positive changes by offering an interactive and rewarding visual timeline of personal growth.

### 4. Swarm Intelligence for Continuous Improvement
- **Integrated Swarm of LLMs:** The Gensyn Swarm functions as a dynamic network where multiple LLMs communicate and collaborate. This "swarm" analyzes the anonymized session data‚Äîcomprising feedback, prompts, and daily snapshots‚Äîto extract actionable insights.
- **Refined Guidance:** The aggregated data is used to generate new, personalized strategies that are sent back to the LLM, ensuring that each session is progressively more aligned with the user's evolving needs.

### 5. Continuous Iterative Loop
- **Feedback Loop:** Each day‚Äôs interactions feed into the swarm, which continuously refines the system's understanding and improves the personalized guidance.
- **Evolving Support:** This iterative loop guarantees that the mental healthcare assistant evolves alongside the user, providing more effective and targeted support over time.

## Optional Document Upload for Enhanced Context
Users can further personalize their experience by optionally uploading personal documents‚Äîsuch as journal entries, therapy histories, or other contextual materials. This data is processed within a **R**etrieval **A**ugmented **G**eneration (RAG) pipeline, which allows the AI psychiatrist to reference the most relevant information during sessions. By incorporating this richer context, the system can deliver more accurate and individualized responses, while maintaining the same secure, TEE-based data protection.

### How it Works
1. **Upload Documents (Optional):** Users have the choice to upload files (PDF, JPG, PNG, TXT, DOC, DOCX) containing personal reflections, goals, or therapy history.  
2. **Secure Storage:** All uploaded data remains confidential within the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), ensuring it is never exposed outside the secure enclave.  
3. **Contextual Retrieval:** When the user engages with the AI psychiatrist, the system quickly retrieves pertinent information from the uploaded documents to deliver more precise and empathic guidance.  
4. **Enhanced Responses:** Because the AI model now has additional context, it can address user concerns more holistically, providing tailored recommendations and follow-up prompts.

> **Note:** Document uploads are entirely optional; users can still benefit from the AI psychiatrist without sharing any personal files. However, providing extra context often results in a more informed and targeted mental health journey.

  CONFIG_PATH="hivemind_exp/configs/mac/grpo-qwen-2.5-0.5b-deepseek-r1.yaml"
  IDENTITY_PATH="$PWD/swarm.pem"

  python -m hivemind_exp.gsm8k.train_single_gpu \
       --hf_token "None" \
       --identity_path "$IDENTITY_PATH" \
       --config "$CONFIG_PATH"
  


## Future Implementations üöÄ

### Fully TEE-hosted LLM Deployment

Currently, our AI is provided by Hivemind and operates as a distributed swarm outside of a TEE. Although effective as a proof-of-concept, configuring this setup is time-consuming and complex for this 3 day hackathon. Future iterations will convert this configuration into a unified, TEE-hosted LLM solution thus providing privacy also.


### Multi-User Adaptive Swarm

Instead of deploying separate personalized models for each user, the plan is to have the swarm cater to multiple users within a single TEE. This integrated approach maintains security and confidentiality while improving overall performance and efficiency through shared, adaptive learning and contextual processing.
